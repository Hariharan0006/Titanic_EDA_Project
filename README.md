Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors affecting passenger survival.
The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns, clean the data, and visualize important relationships using Python.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the structure of the Titanic dataset

Handle missing values and outliers

Perform univariate and bivariate analysis

Find correlations between variables

Visualize patterns that influenced survival rate

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Tool	Purpose
Python	Core programming language
Pandas	Data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy	Numerical computations
Matplotlib / Seaborn	Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook	Interactive analysis environment
📊 Steps Performed

Data Loading – Imported dataset and viewed initial structure

Data Cleaning – Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)

Exploratory Analysis – Found patterns between gender, class, and survival

Correlation Analysis – Used heatmap to see numeric relationships

Visualization – Created bar plots, count plots, and boxplots

📈 Key Insights

Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.

1st class passengers were more likely to survive.

Younger passengers had better survival chances.

Missing values in the Age and Cabin columns were significant and needed careful handling.
